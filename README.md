## Introduction

Simple Windows console version of the game [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)).

The red snake can be moved around the screen using the <kbd>←</kbd>, <kbd>→</kbd>, <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> buttons to reach the green apple. Each time the snake eats a piece of fruit the tail grows by one cell. The objective of the game is to collect all the fruit without the snake hitting either one of the four walls, or its own tail.
